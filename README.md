# hello-world

I was asked to talk a bit of myself. I am a teacher, a trainer, an actor, a father, a husband. I always tries to find some new territories to develope myself. And when I was a child I really wanted to be a giraffe. For long I thuoght I won't. 
But I can act!
So I can be anything...
...and anybody.
